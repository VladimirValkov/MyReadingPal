# MyReadingPal

MyReadingPal is a web app based on Django Framework.
It's main goals are to help users create a list of books that they have read throughout their life. MyReadingPal allows them to add, edit or
delete books and display it to everyone if checked. It also allows them to see other people's lists and like them if they want.
Users can check who has liked their list and contact them. Not logged users can view all book lists, but they cannot like, edit, delete any of them.
